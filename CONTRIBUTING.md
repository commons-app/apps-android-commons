Thanks for considering to contribute to this project! A few guidelines for
people who want to contribute their code to this software are documented in
[this project's Wiki](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines).
If you're not sure where to start head on to [this wiki page](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/wiki/Volunteers-welcome!).

Here's a gist of the guidelines,

# Make separate commits for logically separate changes

# Describe your changes well in the commit message

The first line of the commit message should be a short description of what has
changed. It is also good to prefix the first line with "area: " where the "area"
is a filename or identifier for the general area of the code being modified.
The body should provide a meaningful commit message.

# Write tests for your code (if possible)

# Make sure the Wiki pages don't become stale by updating them (if needed)
