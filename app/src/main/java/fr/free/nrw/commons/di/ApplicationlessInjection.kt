// ApplicationlessInjection is no longer needed with Hilt.
// All activities, fragments, services, etc. should use @AndroidEntryPoint annotation instead.
// For non-Android classes that need dependencies, use @EntryPoint interfaces.
//
// This file is kept as a placeholder to avoid breaking imports in case there are any remaining references.
// All actual functionality has been migrated to Hilt's @AndroidEntryPoint and @EntryPoint patterns.
