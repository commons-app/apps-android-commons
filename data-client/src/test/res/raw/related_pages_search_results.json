        "extract": "The dingo is a type of feral dog native to Australia. Its taxonomic status is debated. The first British colonists to arrive established a settlement at Port Jackson in 1788 and recorded dingoes living there with indigenous Australians. Although the dingo exists in the wild, it associates with humans but has not been selectively bred as have other domesticated animals. It is a medium-sized canid that possesses a lean, hardy body adapted for speed, agility and stamina. The dingo's three main coat colours are described as being either light ginger, black and tan, or creamy white. The head is the widest part of the dingo, is wedge-shaped, and large in proportion to the body. The dingo skull differs to that of the domestic dog by its larger palatal width, longer rostrum, shorter skull height, and wider sagittal crest. One can regard the dingo as an ecotype or an ecospecies which has adapted to Australia's unique environment. It is listed as a \"vulnerable species\" on the IUCN Red List due to declining numbers caused by hybridization with the domestic dog.",
